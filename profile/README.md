## Our mission:
We firmly daresay that everyone has the opportunity to do great things if they constantly strive towards it. However, it is overwhelming to know how to do it. At Strivescope, we strive for helping people who like to strive to focus their efforts into their goals. We also want to make more people aware of the amazing things they can do by striving constantly towards their goals.

## Our values:
At Strivescope we have 3 core values which we believe to be fundamental to improve as a person and software developer:

- **Determination:** We daresay that everyone should be determined to reach their goals because only in this way they will be able to get their full potential always.
- **Self-knowledge:** It is really important to know oneself in order to know what you're doing good and what you're doing wrong so you can get to improve the negative aspects.
- **Care for others:** Caring for others is fundamental to be able to collaborate with each other and reach the common good.

## Why joining Strivescope?
- **Help each other in FOSS projects:** Strivescope encourages collaborating with other people in Free and Open Source Software projects to make impactful software together.
- **Network with other people who share our interests:** You can learn from others while helping and being helped. It is much more pleasant and easier to learn with other people than learning alone.
